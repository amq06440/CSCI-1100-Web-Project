<h1>Why I love The Basement Yard Podcast</h1>
<IMG src="BasementYardLogo.jpg" alt="The Basement Yard Logo" width="175" height="175">
<p>Hi everyone! I created this website to show my appreciation for Joe Santagato and his podcast called "The Basement Yard." Below I included links to the podcast's YouTube page, SoundCloud, and Patreon.
I will admit, some of the topics can get a little mature (just a warning). Regardless, I think it's extremely underrated and hilarious. No joke I could have the worst day ever, and this podcast makes me feel so much better. There have been a few times I've laughed so hard I cried and started to snort. If I haven't convinced you to listen to it yet, you have no excuse at this point. Now, you may access the content on this fansite! Happy listening!</p>
<p><b>LEGAL DISCLAIMER: I AM JUST A FAN OF "THE BASEMENT YARD" PODCAST. THIS IS JUST A FANSITE I CREATED OUT OF PURE APPRECIATION FOR IT. JOE SANTAGATO TAKES FULL CREDIT FOR THE BASEMENT YARD PODCAST. I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CONTENT, AND I AM NOT TRYING TO TAKE ANY CREDIT AWAY FROM JOE SANTAGATO.</b></p> 
<p>The Basement Yard is a podcast hosted by YouTuber Joe Santagato with one or more of his friends joining as special guests.
Every Monday, Santagato releases a new episode in which he and guest(s) discuss just about anything and everything. The podcasts are so relatable which is most likely the cause of its growing popularity.
The podcast can be found for free on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_a6c3KLo9reMOqn2pbvMqg">Youtube</a>, Spotify, and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thebasementyard">SoundCloud</a>.
Fans can even support the show by donating to their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/TheBasementYard">Patreon</a> which comes with some special perks. I would donate, but I'm a broke college student...#relatable
